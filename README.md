# Bayes Probability Module
The bayes.py module contains various functions for calculating probability-based classifications using the [Bayes Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem).

## Using the Module
Import bayes.py into your project. If you're looking to train on an existing set of training data, call the learnAndClassify function. The module also contains functions for getting prior probability, likelihood, evidence, and posterior probability.
